# patreon-should-be-doing-this
This is a lightweight python script with minimal dependencies with the sole purpose of consolidating the `.csv` files Patreon puts out every month for their creators into one, so you can figure out how much someone has donated within a time frame without having to cross reference the sheets manually.

## Usage
The script has been written for python 2.5+, upon execution it will present a file selection dialog that lets you select any number of `.csv` files to be consolidated into one.
After the files have been selected the script will output a file called `consolidated_patreon_data.csv` into the script's folder.

### Output File structure
The `.csv` file output by the script contains the following structure of columns:

| First name | Last name | E-Mail | Start | Lifetime | Total Pledge | Individual Pledges separated by month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Issues
The `.csv` files generated by Patreon do not contain any immutable unique identifiers for your patrons, so the best the script can do to identify the same user on multiple sheets is to compare their e-mail adresses at the moment.
Since the e-mail adress of a user might change at any point, any donations that have been placed under different e-mail adresses by the same user won't be consolidated automatically.
